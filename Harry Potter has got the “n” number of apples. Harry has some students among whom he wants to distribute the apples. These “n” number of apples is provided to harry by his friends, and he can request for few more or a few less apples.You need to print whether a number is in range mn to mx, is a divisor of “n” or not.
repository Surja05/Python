# Harry Potter has got the “n” number of apples. Harry has some students among whom he wants to distribute the apples. These “n” number of apples is provided to harry by his friends, and he can request for few more or a few less apples.You need to print whether a number is in range mn to mx, is a divisor of “n” or not.

# n = int(input("Enter the Total number of apples present\n"))
# max = int(input("Enter the Maximum number of apples needed\n"))
# min = int(input("Enter the Minimum number of apples needed\n"))

# for i in range(max, min+1):
#     if n%i == 0:
#         print(f"{i} is a divisor of {n}")
#     else:
#         print(f"{i} is not a divisor of {n}")
